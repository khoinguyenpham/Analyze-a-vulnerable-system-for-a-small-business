# 3. Use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a security incident

In this project, I will use the knowledge you’ve gained about networks throughout this course to analyze a network incident. I will analyze the situation using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF).

## Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. Your organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.

During the attack, your organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. 

The company’s cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 

As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with using this security event to create a plan to improve your company’s network security, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). You will use the CSF to help you navigate through the different steps of analyzing this cybersecurity incident and integrate your analysis into a general security strategy

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Preparation

Preparing supporting materials: NIST CSF

### Step 2: Identify the kind of attack and the systems affected

Determining what type of attack occurred and which systems were affected.

### Step 3: Protect assets from being compromised

Next, you will assess where the organization can improve to further protect its assets. In this step, you will focus on creating an immediate action plan to respond to the cybersecurity incident. When creating this plan, reflect on the following question: What systems or procedures need to be updated or changed to further secure the organization’s assets?

### Step 4: Determine how to detect similar incidents in future

Consider ways you and your team can monitor and analyze network traffic, software applications, track authorized versus unauthorized users, and detect any unusual activity on user accounts. 

### Step 5: Create a response plan for future cybersecurity incidents

You will create a response plan for future cybersecurity incidents. Some items to consider when creating a response plan to any cybersecurity incident:

How can you and your team contain cybersecurity incidents and affected devices?

What procedures are in place to help you and your team neutralize cybersecurity incidents?

What data or information can be used to analyze this incident?

How can your organization’s recovery process be improved to better handle future cybersecurity incidents?

### Step 6: Help organization recover from the incident

Reflect on all the information you gathered about the incident in the previous steps to consider which devices, systems, and processes need to be restored and recovered. 

Consider the following questions: 

What information do you need to be able to recover immediately? 

What processes are in place to help the organization recover from the incident?

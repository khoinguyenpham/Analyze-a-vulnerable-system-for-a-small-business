# 4. Use Linux commands to manage file permissions

In this project, I will use Linux commands to manage file permissions by checking permissions for files in a directory, checking for incorrect file permissions and changing permissions as needed, as well as removing unauthorized access to a directory.

## Scenario

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

## Target

I will examine existing permissions on the file system. I’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, I’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

## Step-By-Step Instruction

### Step 1: Preparation

Preparing the related materials: Current file permissions.

The Current file permissions document demonstrates how the file structure is built for this project. The file permissions for each file or directory are also provided.

### Step 2: Check file and directory details

In this step, you must explore the permissions of the projects directory and the files it contains. You must ist the contents and permissions of the projects directory and see the permissions of the files in the projects directory are as follows.

### Step 3: Change file permissions

In this step, you must determine whether any files have incorrect permissions and then change the permissions as needed. This action will remove unauthorized access and strengthen security on the system.

### Step 4: Change file permissions on a hidden file

In this step, you must determine if a hidden file has incorrect permissions and then change the permissions as needed. This action will further remove unauthorized access and strengthen security on the system.

### Step 5: Change directory permissions

In this step, you must change the permissions of a directory. First, you’ll check the group permissions of the /home/researcher2/projects/drafts directory and then modify the permissions as required.In this project, you must determine if a hidden file has incorrect permissions and then change the permissions as needed. This action will further remove unauthorized access and strengthen security on the system.

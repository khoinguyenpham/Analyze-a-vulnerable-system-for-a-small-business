# Analyze-a-vulnerable-system-for-a-small-business
In this project, I will conduct a vulnerability assessment for a small business. I will evaluate the risks of a vulnerable information system and outline a remediation plan.

## Scenario
I am a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, I recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

## Target
I must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

## Step-By-Step Instructions
### Part 1: Preparation
-Prepare NIST framework material
-Review information about the vulnerable server
Vulnerability assessments typically include a description of the system being evaluated and the scope of the project:
+System Description highlights the relevant components, architecture, and dependencies of the system being assessed. All of these parts and connections make up the attack surface of the vulnerable information system.
+Scope specifies the focus and boundaries of the assessment. For example, you might specify that the scope of this assessment only relates to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data on the serverâ€”not the physical security of the server or its related IT systems.

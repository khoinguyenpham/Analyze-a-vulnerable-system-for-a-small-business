# 1. Analyze a vulnerable system for a small business
In this project, I will conduct a vulnerability assessment for a small business. I will evaluate the risks of a vulnerable information system and outline a remediation plan.

## Scenario

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

## Target

I must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Preparation

#### Related materials

NIST Framework: NIST SP 800-30

#### Review information about vulnerable server

Vulnerability assessments typically include a description of the system being evaluated and the scope of the project.

The System Description highlights the relevant components, architecture, and dependencies of the system being assessed. All of these parts and connections make up the attack surface of the vulnerable information system.

The Scope specifies the focus and boundaries of the assessment. For example, you might specify that the scope of this assessment only relates to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data on the server—not the physical security of the server or its related IT systems.

### Step 2: Perform a risk assessment

#### Explain the purpose of the information system

This section helps stakeholders understand the underlying objective and intended outcome of your analysis. A purpose statement also connects the technical objectives of your analysis with the organization's goals.

#### Identify potential threat sources

Explore the Threat sources section of the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 resource. Using what you know about the vulnerable database server, notice the threat types and examples described.

#### Identify potential threat events

NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 provides a comprehensive list of possible security incidents that could compromise a vulnerable information system—labeled Threat events. The list considers the average intent and capabilities of the threat source categories of the publication.

#### Calculate the risk of potential threats

Estimate a Likelihood score (1-3) and Severity score (1-3) for each threat and add your scores to the corresponding columns of the Risk Assessment table in your template. After, calculate an overall Risk score (1-9) for each threat using the formula (likelihood x severity = risk).

### Step 3: Propose security recommendations

#### Explain your approach

This helps stakeholders understand your thought process of evaluating the risks you've identified—adding valuable context for stakeholders.

#### Propose a remediation strategy

Overall, a vulnerability assessment report should outline a strategy for addressing the risks of the target system. When possible, it should provide stakeholders with actionable steps that can be taken to remediate, or fix, vulnerabilities to avoid threats.

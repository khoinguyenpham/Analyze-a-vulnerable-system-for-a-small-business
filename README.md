# Analyze-a-vulnerable-system-for-a-small-business
In this project, I will conduct a vulnerability assessment for a small business. I will evaluate the risks of a vulnerable information system and outline a remediation plan.

## Scenario
I am a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, I recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

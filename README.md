# 1. Analyze a vulnerable system for a small business

In this project, I will conduct a vulnerability assessment for a small business. I will evaluate the risks of a vulnerable information system and outline a remediation plan.

# 2. Conduct a security audit

In this project, I will conduct an internal security audit.

# 3. Use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a security incident

In this project, I will use the knowledge youâ€™ve gained about networks throughout this course to analyze a network incident. I will analyze the situation using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF).

# 4. Use Linux commands to manage file permissions

In this project, I will use Linux commands to manage file permissions by checking permissions for files in a directory, checking for incorrect file permissions and changing permissions as needed, as well as removing unauthorized access to a directory.

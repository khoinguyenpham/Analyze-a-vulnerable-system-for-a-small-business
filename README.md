# 1. Analyze a vulnerable system for a small business

## Scenario

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

## Target

I must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Preparation

#### Related materials

NIST Framework: NIST SP 800-30

#### Review information about vulnerable server

Vulnerability assessments typically include a description of the system being evaluated and the scope of the project.

The System Description highlights the relevant components, architecture, and dependencies of the system being assessed. All of these parts and connections make up the attack surface of the vulnerable information system.

The Scope specifies the focus and boundaries of the assessment. For example, you might specify that the scope of this assessment only relates to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data on the serverâ€”not the physical security of the server or its related IT systems.
